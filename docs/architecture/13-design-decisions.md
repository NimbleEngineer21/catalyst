## Appendix A: Key Design Decisions

### Why TypeScript/Node.js for CLI?

**Decision:** Use TypeScript/Node.js instead of Ruby, Go, or Rust

**Rationale:**
1. **Single Runtime**: MCP servers require Node.js - using it for CLI eliminates Ruby dependency
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
3. **Code Sharing**: Can share types and utilities between CLI and MCP servers
4. **Developer Familiarity**: Target audience (AI developers) more likely to know TypeScript
5. **Ecosystem**: npm has excellent CLI tooling and libraries

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Smaller distribution (no separate Ruby runtime)
- ✅ Faster development (one language)
- ❌ Slightly slower startup than compiled languages (acceptable for CLI)
- ❌ Larger node_modules than Ruby gems (mitigated by bundling)

### Why Homebrew Distribution?

**Decision:** Use Homebrew as primary distribution method

**Rationale:**
1. **Developer Standard**: All macOS developers know Homebrew
2. **Version Management**: Built-in upgrade/downgrade capabilities
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic Node.js installation
4. **Clean Uninstall**: `brew uninstall` removes everything
5. **Discoverability**: `brew search catalyst`

**Alternatives Considered:**
- npm global install: Requires Node.js pre-installed, less discoverable
- Direct download: No automatic updates, manual PATH management
- macOS Installer (.pkg): More complex, overkill for dev tool

### Why Bundled BMAD vs Direct Installation?

**Decision:** Bundle BMAD in Catalyst distribution, create symlinks on user machine

**Rationale:**
1. **Version Control**: Ensures BMAD version matches Catalyst version
2. **Offline Installation**: Works without internet after initial Homebrew download
3. **Consistency**: All users get same BMAD version
4. **Updates**: BMAD updates tied to Catalyst updates

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Predictable behavior across installations
- ✅ Simpler for users (no separate BMAD install)
- ❌ Larger distribution size (~10MB for BMAD bundles)
- ❌ Can't independently update BMAD (acceptable - we control both)

## Appendix B: Future Architecture Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements (v2.1+)

#### 1. Web Dashboard
- Optional web UI for configuration
- Visualize MCP server status
- BMAD agent activity logs

#### 2. Plugin System
- Third-party MCP server marketplace
- Community-contributed agents
- Extension API for custom commands

#### 3. Multi-Platform Support
- Linux distribution (community-driven)
- Windows via WSL2
- Cross-platform MCP servers

#### 4. Team Features
- Shared configurations via Git
- Team-wide MCP server deployments
- Centralized secret management

### Scalability Considerations

**Current Architecture Supports:**
- 100,000+ installations
- 20+ MCP servers per user
- Large project repositories (1000+ files)

**Future Scaling Needs:**
- MCP server health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Automatic crash reporting
- Usage analytics (opt-in)
