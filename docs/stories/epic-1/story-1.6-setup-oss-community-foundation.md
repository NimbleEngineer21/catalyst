# Story 1.6: Set Up Open-Source Community Foundation

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Project Scaffolding & Development Environment
**Story ID:** 1.6
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Status:** Done
**Estimated Effort:** 5 hours

---

## User Story

**As a** project maintainer,
**I want** proper open-source governance files and configuration,
**so that** the project is ready for community contributions from day one.

---

## Context

This story establishes the open-source governance foundation for Catalyst, including license, code of conduct, contribution guidelines, security policy, and GitHub issue/PR templates. This ensures the project is welcoming, well-governed, and ready for community engagement.

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.1: Initialize TypeScript Project Structure
- Story 1.5: Set Up Local Development Workflow (CONTRIBUTING.md references development.md)

**Enables:**
- Story 1.7: Create Multi-Audience Top-Level README (references these governance files)
- Story 1.8: Configure GitHub Repository for Community (uses these templates)
- Community contributions and engagement

**Reference Documentation:**
- [OSS Community Readiness Guide](../OSS_COMMUNITY_READINESS.md) - Complete guidance for this story

## Technical Implementation Notes

### LICENSE
The LICENSE file already exists with GNU AGPL v3.0. Verify it's complete and properly formatted.

### CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md Structure

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email: **security@catalystproject.dev**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix Development:** Varies by severity
- **Disclosure:** Coordinated with reporter

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure:
1. Vulnerability reported privately
2. Fix developed and tested
3. Release published
4. Public disclosure (with credit to reporter)

## Security Best Practices

When using Catalyst:
- Keep Node.js and npm updated
- Don't commit secrets to git (.env files excluded)
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Review MCP server permissions before enabling
- Keep Catalyst updated to latest version

## Known Security Considerations

- **AGPL License:** Ensures modifications remain open source
- **MCP Servers:** Review permissions before installation
- **Local File Access:** Catalyst can read/write local files (by design)
- **Shell Commands:** Catalyst executes shell commands (by design)

## Questions?

For security questions (not vulnerabilities), use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/your-org/catalyst/discussions).

---

## Testing Strategy

**For this story:**
- Manual verification: All files created and properly formatted
- Verify CODEOWNERS syntax with GitHub's validator
- Test issue templates by creating sample issues (after Story 1.9)
- Verify all links in governance files are correct
- Review LICENSE is complete GNU AGPL v3.0 text

**Success Criteria:**
- All governance files in place
- Files follow community standards
- GitHub recognizes templates and CODEOWNERS

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [x] LICENSE file complete (GNU AGPL v3.0)
- [x] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md created (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- [x] CODEOWNERS file created with @azywicki
- [x] GitHub issue templates created (bug, feature, question)
- [x] Pull request template created
- [x] SECURITY.md created with responsible disclosure process
- [x] package.json metadata updated (author, repository, keywords, bugs, homepage)
- [x] All files follow GitHub conventions and best practices
- [ ] Code committed with clear commit message
- [ ] Story reviewed and accepted by PO

---

## Notes

- **License Already Exists:** LICENSE file was created earlier with AGPL-3.0
- **Email Addresses:** Use appropriate contact emails (security@, conduct@)
  - For now, can use GitHub Issues for enforcement until domain/email setup
- **CODEOWNERS Evolution:** As team grows, add more specific owners for areas
- **Issue Templates:** GitHub will show these when users create issues
- **Template Updates:** These can be refined based on community feedback
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Add more specific issue templates (documentation, performance, etc.)
  - Add GitHub Actions for automated issue labeling
  - Create issue forms with more validation
  - Add FUNDING.yml if accepting sponsorships
