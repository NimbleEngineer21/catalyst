# Story 1.9: Initialize Git Repository and First Commit

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Project Scaffolding & Development Environment
**Story ID:** 1.9
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Status:** Approved
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

## User Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the repository initialized with proper Git configuration,
**so that** we can track changes from the beginning.

---

## Context

This story initializes the Git repository, creates the initial commit with all project scaffolding, and prepares the repository for pushing to GitHub. This is the culmination of Epic 1, marking the project as ready for active development.

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.1: Initialize TypeScript Project Structure
- Story 1.2: Set Up Testing Infrastructure
- Story 1.3: Configure Build and Development Scripts
- Story 1.4: Create Core Utility Modules
- Story 1.5: Set Up Local Development Workflow
- Story 1.6: Set Up Open-Source Community Foundation
- Story 1.7: Create Multi-Audience Top-Level README
- Story 1.8: Configure GitHub Repository for Community (completed *after* this story)

**Enables:**
- Pushing to GitHub remote
- Story 1.8: Configure GitHub Repository (GitHub settings configured after push)
- Version control and collaboration
- Epic 2 development work

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Git Initialization Commands

```bash
# 1. Initialize repository
git init

# 2. Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -m main

# 3. Configure author
git config user.name "azywicki"
git config user.email "81277290+NimbleEngineer21@users.noreply.github.com"

# 4. Check what will be committed
git status

# 5. Review .gitignore is working
# (node_modules/, dist/ should NOT appear in git status)

# 6. Add all files
git add .

# 7. Review staged files
git status

# 8. Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete planning phase

- PRD complete (8 documents)
- Architecture complete (13 documents)
- Epic/story planning complete (6 epics, 47 stories)
- OSS foundation established (AGPL-3.0 license)
- Documentation structure organized
- TypeScript project scaffolded
- Testing infrastructure set up
- Build scripts configured
- Core utility modules implemented
- Development workflow documented
- Open-source governance files created
- Multi-audience README created
- BMAD and Memory MCP contexts configured

# 9. Verify commit
git log --oneline
git show HEAD
```

### After Initial Commit (Not Part of This Story)

```bash
# 10. Add GitHub remote (after creating repo on GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/catalyst.git

# 11. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Then proceed to Story 1.8 to configure GitHub repository settings
```

### Verifying .gitignore

Before committing, verify .gitignore is working:

```bash
# These should NOT appear in `git status`:
- node_modules/
- dist/
- coverage/
- .env (if it exists)
- .DS_Store

# If they appear, check .gitignore syntax
```

### Sensitive Data Check

Before committing, search for common secrets:

```bash
# Search for potential secrets
grep -r "api_key" .
grep -r "password" .
grep -r "token" .
grep -r "secret" .

# If found, ensure they're in .env files (which are gitignored)
```

## Architecture References

- [Development Workflow](../../architecture/11-development-workflow.md) - Git workflow
- [Project Structure](../../architecture/10-project-structure.md) - What files exist

---

## Testing Strategy

**For this story:**
- Run `git status` after init - should see untracked files
- Run `git status` after adding .gitignore - should NOT see node_modules/, dist/, etc.
- Run `git log` after commit - should show initial commit
- Verify commit message is properly formatted
- Verify `git show HEAD` displays all committed files
- Verify no sensitive data in commit

**Success Criteria:**
- Git repository initialized successfully
- Initial commit contains all project files
- No sensitive data committed
- Clean `git status` after commit
- Ready to push to GitHub

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] `.gitignore` working correctly
- [ ] Git author configured
- [ ] All project files staged (reviewed, no sensitive data)
- [ ] Initial commit created with comprehensive message
- [ ] `main` branch established
- [ ] `git log` shows initial commit
- [ ] `git status` is clean
- [ ] Repository ready for GitHub push
- [ ] Pre-push checklist completed
- [ ] Story reviewed and accepted by PO

---

## Notes

- **Branch Name:** Use `main` not `master` (modern convention)
- **Commit Message:** Should tell the story of Epic 1 completion
- **Co-authorship:** Credit BMAD agents who contributed to planning
- **Timing:** This story is the LAST story in Epic 1
- **After This Story:**
  - Push to GitHub
  - Complete Story 1.8 (configure GitHub settings)
  - Begin Epic 2 (Core CLI Implementation)
- **Git History:** Keep clean from the start - no "WIP" or "oops" commits
- **Atomic Commits:** For Epic 1, one comprehensive initial commit is appropriate
- **Future Commits:** Follow conventional commits for all future work

### Conventional Commits for Future Reference

After Epic 1, use conventional commits:

```
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
test: add tests
chore: update build scripts
refactor: refactor code
style: format code
perf: improve performance
ci: update CI/CD
```

### Next Steps After Story 1.9

1. âœ… Create GitHub repository (if not exists)
2. âœ… Push initial commit: `git push -u origin main`
3. âœ… Complete Story 1.8: Configure GitHub repository settings
4. âœ… Celebrate Epic 1 completion! ðŸŽ‰
5. âœ… Begin Epic 2: Core CLI Implementation
