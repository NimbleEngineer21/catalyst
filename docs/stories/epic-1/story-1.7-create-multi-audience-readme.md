# Story 1.7: Create Multi-Audience Top-Level README

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Project Scaffolding & Development Environment
**Story ID:** 1.7
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Status:** Approved
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

---

## User Story

**As a** visitor to the Catalyst repository,
**I want** a clear, accessible README that helps me understand the project regardless of my role,
**so that** I can quickly determine if Catalyst is useful for me and how to get started.

---

## Context

This story creates the main README.md file that serves as the front door to the Catalyst project. It must effectively communicate value to multiple audiences: general public, end users, developers, and potential contributors.

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.1: Initialize TypeScript Project Structure (replaces placeholder README)
- Story 1.5: Set Up Local Development Workflow (README links to development guide)
- Story 1.6: Set Up Open-Source Community Foundation (README references governance files)

**Enables:**
- Story 1.8: Configure GitHub Repository for Community (README is primary landing page)
- Project marketing and visibility
- Developer recruitment
- Community engagement

**Reference Documentation:**
- [README Template](../templates/README-template-example.md) - Complete template for this story
- [OSS Community Readiness](../OSS_COMMUNITY_READINESS.md) - Multi-audience README guidance
